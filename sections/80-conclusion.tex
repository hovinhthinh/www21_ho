\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents the first method, called QuTE, for
extracting quantity facts from web tables,
to support queries with quantity filters.
In experiments, QuTE clearly outperforms both prior works
on text-based Qfacts and a major search engine.
An overarching goal of this work is to extensively
populate a high-quality knowledge base with quantity properties,
including advanced measures such as energy consumption
and carbon footprint for car models.
This is ongoing and future work.
