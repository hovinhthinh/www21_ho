\section*{Appendix: QuTE Demo}

Figure \ref{fig:demo} shows a screenshot of the QuTE prototype for quantity search, with the top 10 results for the query ``technology companies with more than 15 billion Euro annual profit''. Result entities and quantities are shown in light green and red, respectively, with conversions in yellow. Context items are colored as follows: page title and DOM-tree headings in orange, surrounding text in cyan, and table caption in green. 
The result at rank 10 is an example where the quantity does not refer to the leftmost E-column, a difficult case for column alignment.
